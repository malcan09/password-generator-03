# password-generator-03

For this assignment we were required to create a password generator to give the user the option to pick a password from 8 characters up to 128 max. Also, being able to use upper and lower cases, as well as numbers and symbols to get a random formal password.

To be able to complete this assignment we had to create a box in which the user had two buttons. One to generate and one to copy. 
Javascript makes the box function to give you a random password. 

  Although, this assignment was tough, it was fun to be able to play around and learn the complex that is javascript.
